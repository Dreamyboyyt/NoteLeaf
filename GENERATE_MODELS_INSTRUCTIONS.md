# Instructions to Generate Missing Model Files

## Problem
The Scene and WorldElement models need their `.g.dart` files generated by the `build_runner` package, but we can't run Flutter commands locally in the workspace.

## Solution
Use the GitHub Actions workflow to generate the files automatically.

## Steps

### 1. Push the code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add workflow to generate model files"
git push
```

### 2. Run the Workflow
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the **Actions** tab
3. Click on **"Generate Model Files"** workflow in the left sidebar
4. Click the **"Run workflow"** button on the right
5. Click the green **"Run workflow"** button in the dropdown

### 3. Download the Generated Files
1. Wait for the workflow to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
2. Once complete, scroll down to the **Artifacts** section
3. Download **"complete-project-with-generated-files"** artifact (it will download as a .zip)

### 4. Extract and Copy to Workspace
```bash
# Unzip the downloaded file
unzip complete-project-with-generated-files.zip -d temp_project

# Copy the generated files to your workspace
cp -r temp_project/* /path/to/your/workspace/

# Clean up
rm -rf temp_project
```

## What Gets Generated
- `lib/models/scene.g.dart` - Hive adapter for Scene model
- `lib/models/world_element.g.dart` - Hive adapter for WorldElement model

## Alternative: Just Download Generated Models
If you only want the generated `.g.dart` files:
1. Download **"generated-model-files"** artifact instead
2. Extract and copy only the `.g.dart` files to `lib/models/`

## Next Steps After Getting Generated Files
Once you have the generated files, we need to:
1. ✅ Register Scene and WorldElement adapters in HiveService
2. ✅ Create world_element_editor_view.dart
3. ✅ Add World Building tab to project workspace
4. ✅ Add Scenes access point in chapters tab
5. ✅ Add Version History access in chapter editor
6. ✅ Test all integrations

**Note**: The workflow will also generate fresh icons using the `flutter_launcher_icons` package with the adaptive icon configuration.
